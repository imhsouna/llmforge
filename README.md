# LLMForge

LLMForge is a next-generation development framework that pairs a Large Language Model (LLM) with a human-in-the-loop approval process. It allows developers to propose features or code changes in natural language, have the LLM generate corresponding code snippets, and then require a human developer’s approval before integrating those changes into a running application. This ensures a secure, reliable, and fast development process.

## Key Concepts

- **LLM-Assisted Development:**  
  Developers describe desired features or changes. The LLM suggests code snippets to implement them.
  
- **Human-in-the-Loop Approval:**  
  Proposed code changes are staged and never deployed until a human developer explicitly approves them.
  
- **Context & Memory (Future Work):**  
  By integrating retrieval-based techniques, the LLM can “remember” the current state of the application, previous design decisions, and approved components.

## Current Status & Roadmap

1. **Initial Setup (Done):**
   - Basic project structure, documentation, and guidelines.
   - A minimal Node.js/Express server running a simple endpoint.
   - CI pipeline and testing framework (Jest) integrated.

2. **LLM Mock & Approval Flow (Current):**
   - A mock LLM interface that generates code snippets based on a textual description.
   - Endpoints to propose new code changes (`/propose`) and to approve them (`/approve/:id`).
   - Tests ensure the propose/approve workflow is functional.

3. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Integrate retrieval-based generation for more intelligent code suggestions.
   - Implement dynamic code integration so approved snippets become part of the running server.
   - Add authentication, security checks, and automated linting for proposed code.
   - Improve developer tooling (CLI, dashboards) and implement a version-controlled history of changes.

## Running the Development Server

**Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
Start the server:

```bash
npm start
Then open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see "LLMForge Server Running".

If port 3000 is in use, you can set a different port via the PORT environment variable.

New Endpoints
POST /propose
Request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/propose \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description":"Add a user route"}'
This returns a JSON response with:

```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "proposal": {
    "description": "Add a user route",
    "codeSnippet": "// Proposed code for: Add a user route\napp.get('/add-a-user-route', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('This is the Add a user route feature.');\n});"
  }
}
POST /approve/:id
Request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/approve/0
This approves the previously proposed code with ID 0. Currently, approval just returns a success message and logs the change. In the future, it will integrate the code into the live server:

```json
{
  "message": "Change #0 approved"
}
Testing
Run tests:

```bash
npm test
The tests use Jest and Supertest to verify:

The /propose endpoint returns a proposed change.
The /approve/:id endpoint approves a previously proposed change.
CI (GitHub Actions) runs tests automatically on each push or pull request to the main branch.
