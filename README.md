# LLMForge

LLMForge is a next-generation development framework that pairs a Large Language Model (LLM) with a human-in-the-loop approval process to produce secure, reliable, and quickly developed web applications.

## Key Concepts

- **LLM-Assisted Development:** The LLM proposes code changes based on developer instructions.
- **Human Approval:** Changes are reviewed and approved by a developer before integration, ensuring security and correctness.
- **Context & Memory:** The LLM can be enhanced with retrieval-based techniques to remember the current state of the codebase.

## Roadmap

1. Establish a basic server and mock LLM interface.
2. Implement a staging area for proposed code and an approval CLI.
3. Integrate automated tests, linting, and security checks.
4. Connect to a real LLM API and implement retrieval augmentation.
5. Launch and gather community feedback.
